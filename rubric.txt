Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

With chatbot systems that replicate human behavior too much, there might be less of a necessity for human jobs.
For example, chatbots that replicate human therapists can take jobs out from humans and put them out of work.
Additionally, chatbots rely on accuracy and training sets rather than human experience. This is different from humans
who have prior life experience that can affect the conversations with patients.

Chatbots can explicitly state at the beginning of beginning of a conversation a disclaimer that they are a chatbot
to remind users that they are not human. Although the goal for programmers is to have their chatbots as human-like
as possible, it is important to make the distinction prior to the conversation.
